## Loading Data and Packages

### Loading in Packages
The functions library() and require() are used to load in data and packages.
Here's a couple of examples: 

```{r}
# Load in the here package and the palmerpenguins package using the require() function
require(here)
require(palmerpenguins)

# Load in those same two packages, but using the library() function
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

Note, these only work if the package has been installed or already exists on your machine.


### Loading Data
Loading in data works a little differently: you can use the here() or read.csv() functions. Here() specifies a subfolder within your working directory.
Here are some examples:

```{r}
# Load in the 2021 ginkgo data to create a data frame called ginkgo
ginko <- read.csv(here("data", "ginkgo_data_2021.csv"))
```









## Data Structures

### C() function
The function c() combines or concatenates its arguments into a vector (a 1-dimensional data structure consisting of 1 or more elements).

* All of the elements must be of the same type.
- I can’t combine character and numeric types in the same call to c()

Here’s two examples using numeric and character data types:


```{r}
## Create a vector of numbers:
num_vec  = c(1, 4, 8, 9, 13, 14)

## Create a vector of characters:
char_vec = c("a", "fish", "data is cool", "tree", "b", "love stats")
```

I can show the contents of a vector by typing the name of the vector, or using the print() function.

```{r}
## Typing the name of the vector into the console prints the contents
num_vec


## The print() function accomplishes the same task:
print(char_vec)

```

### Length() function
The length() function can be used to get the length of a vector, and also set the length.

Here's an example using the num_vec from before
```{r}
#Determine length of num_vec
length(num_vec)
```
### Matrix() function

The matrix() function is used to create a matrix from a given set of values. You can input a data vector, set the number of columns, and set the number of rows.
```{r}
#Create a matrix from the num_vec vector
matrix(num_vec, nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
```

### data.frame() function 

The data.frame() function is used to create a dataframe, which is a fundamental data structure in r. 

The difference between a matrix and a dataframe is that a dataframe allows you to have columns of differing data types (numeric, logical, character, etc.).
```{r}
#Combine char_vec and num_vec
data.frame(char_vec, num_vec)
```

### Using ginkgo data.frame with nrow(), ncol(), and dim()

Nrow(), ncol(), and dim() are each useful in learning more about the data structure of an object.

* nrow() tells number of rows
* ncol() tells number of columns
* dim() tells
